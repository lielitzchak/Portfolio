          <h1> Hello there!</h1>
          <p>
            I'm Liel Itzchak, a passionate and versatile full stack developer
            dedicated to crafting seamless digital experiences from concept to
            deployment. With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend
            technologies, I thrive on bringing creative ideas to life through
            code.
          </p>
          <p>
            What excites me most about being a full stack developer is the
            opportunity to work on diverse projects, collaborating with teams to
            deliver innovative solutions that make a tangible impact. Whether
            it's building responsive user interfaces or designing robust server
            architectures, I'm always eager to embrace new technologies and
            methodologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech
            landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond coding, I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and
            growth, constantly seeking out opportunities to expand my knowledge
            and refine my craft. I'm always eager to take on new challenges that
            push the boundaries of what's possible.
