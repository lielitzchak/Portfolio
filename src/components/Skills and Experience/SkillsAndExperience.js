          Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 10 years
          ago, Iâ€™ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
          collaborated with talented people to create web products for both
          business and consumer use. I create successful responsive websites
          that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices. The main
          area of my expertise is front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building
          small and medium web apps, custom plugins, features, animations, and
          coding interactive layouts. I also have full-stack developer
          experience with popular open-source CMS like (WordPress, Drupal,
          Magento, Keystone.js and others) . Visit my LinkedIn profile for more
          details or just contact me.
